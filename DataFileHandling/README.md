# About

This guide provides instructions on how to store data files in the Hub via official Mindstorms and Spike apps.
It also explains how to read and manage these files.

The core of this method is using some Slots on the Hub as data storage.
The method differs for Spike 3 and Mindstorms/ Spike Legacy, so they have their directories and README files.
The method consists of the data storing guide and Python code snippets to read this data.
The snippets are divided into two complexity levels:

* Basic: a simple solution with minimum lines of code. May have some limitations.
* Advanced: a more complex solution using functions. Provides some degree of automatization.
